### Where I'm from

I was born and raised in the city of Cincinnati, Ohio â€” right next to train tracks and a creek where I could catch [crawdads](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/invertebrates/facts/crawdads) (_definitely_ not "crayfish").

I moved to Kansas when I was around 8 years old - and completed my pre-college education at the Andover school district. The bulk of my passions in high school concerned computers and coding; however, I also appreciated the soft sciences. From there, I made my way to the University of Oklahoma, where I currently am pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in psychology and taking computer science and music courses on the side.

### What I do now

Currently, I conduct research in a variety of subdisciplines; however, my area of specialty lies in quantitative methodology. I also spend my time building keyboards and writing music (when I'm not playing video games). [Take a look at my research!]({{ site.baseurl }}/research)

### Where I'm at now

Today, I live in Norman, OK. When I'm not working or attending class, you can find me walking around Main street or nearly entering cardiac arrest on a bicycle. I also love to frequent some of the coffee shops around the city, especially Gray Owl and Yellow Dog.

### Why quantitative methodology?

When I was a freshman, I entered college as a double-major in piano and psychology. I had dual aspirations with this degree combination: I wanted to be able to pursue my artistic passions through music, and I wanted to acheive my dream of being a therapist. However, two roadblocks hit me almost immediately. I didn't realize the amount of practice required to major in musical performance, and I also discovered that I could have conversations of the nature I appreciated without needing to be formally trained in clinical methodology (albeit not as professionally). I initially wanted to be a therapist to be able to improve the lives of others, but I witnessed myself being able to help people simply by talking to them as a friend. On top of these observations, I also noticed that I missed doing the math and coding I conducted in high school. So, my junior year of college, I immersed myself in a variety of research experiences. The more I lived in the world of research, the more I appreciated merging the applied nature of my psychology education with the mathematical nature of statistical modeling. It might be a little bit nerdy, but I'm glad to be where I'm at.
