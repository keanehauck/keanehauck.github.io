The rapid emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education has sparked numerous discussions about its implications for both students and faculty. ChatGPT, a prominent AI conversational model, has attracted significant attention for its ability to generate essays, formulate responses, and provide information. The current study presents comprehensive data on college students' ChatGPT usage patterns, attitudes, and perceptions of cheating behavior. Our findings reveal that students use ChatGPT for information gathering more frequently than for response generation or self-improvement. Students are primarily motivated to use ChatGPT for value and convenience, as opposed to hedonistic reasons. Notably, students are able to correctly identify academically unethical uses of ChatGPT as cheating. The outcomes of this research provide valuable insights into how college students are currently interacting with AI tools. Additionally, our findings offer practical knowledge for universities developing policies surrounding AI use in the classroom. By equipping instructors with accurate information about the pervasiveness of ChatGPT in academia, this study contributes to the ongoing discourse on the role of AI in higher education.
