How do people learn? This question is obviously multifaceted, and has multiple answers. One method through which performance-based learning occurs, promoted by Dr. Eric Day, is the idea that individuals first engage in the strategy of exploration (investigating novel information) and then eventually settle into the strategy of exploitation (utilizing what they know in order to perform in the workplace). This pattern is captured by the Dynamic Exploration-Exploitation Learning Model (DEEL), which theorizes that individuals separate task effort into the two categories depending on their circumstances. 

I assist Dr. Day's lab through development and modification of video games designed to test one's tendency for exploration vs. exploitation.
