I received my copy of this book from a vending machine in the Budapest metro—they were scattered throughout the city and I wanted a novel as a souvenir. I was travling with my friend Flora and she recommended *The Paul Street Boys* as a classic of Hungarian literature.

It certainly didn't disappoint. It started off a bit slow, but the reader quickly becomes enamored with the various characters. The book exemplifies the prototypical "boys club" taken to the highest level: strict government, military order, a home base, and love for fellow classmates. Although the novel is a fun read throughout, the ending manages to tug on your heartstrings. All in all, it's a perfect example of ultimate boyish freedom mixed with the realities of life. I even got a little jealous that I didn't have a Janos Boka to follow as a kid.
