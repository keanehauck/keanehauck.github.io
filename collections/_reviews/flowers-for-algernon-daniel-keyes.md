This book scared the crap out of me in high school. The prospect of being fully aware of one's demise is just about the most horrifying thing I could imagine. I remember reading the passages about the wrath evoked from acknowleding the eventual loss of others and of the self, and just telling myself that I would probably never sign up for any mystery drug trials.

It's a classic, though. Very quick on the re-read, so I recommend.
