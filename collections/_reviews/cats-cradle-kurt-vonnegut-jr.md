One of my favorite novels of all time.

This was the book that introduced me to Vonnegut, and I couldn't wait to read more. I remember falling in love with the analogy of a Cat's Cradle itself: something that *seems* to be "looks one thing but is really another," but in fact really does fulfill some deeper purpose. 

Vonnegut takes this analogy and extends it to satirize science, technology, religion, and war, all in the same novel. It takes a damn good author to do that.
