This novella deserves all the praise I can give it.

At first, the flowery language and hyper-romantic prose was offputting. The more I read the story, though, the more it felt fitting and the more I fell into the two characters. Red and Blue weave a love story through time that revels in all the ideals of expression and self-sacrifice. My favorite line was this:

"What will I do, sky? Lake, what? Bluebird, iris, ultramarine, how can there be more when this is done?"

Another thing I liked about the book is the contrast between urban utopia and natural utopia. At a research conference in San Antonio, I sat through a talk that discussed these two diametrically opposed ideas in human thought. Good call-back for me.
