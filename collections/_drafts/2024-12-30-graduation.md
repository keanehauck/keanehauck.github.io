Boomer! I recently graduated from the University of Oklahoma with my B.S. in Psychology with Honors, *Summa Cum Laude*, with Minors in Computer Science and Music. Apparently, the longer it takes you to say your degree and all relevant qualifications, the more impressive it is, so that's why I get to look really pretentious whenever I list it on an application. (No fair! Multidisciplinary Studies: Concentration in Public Promotion & Social Perception majors have *such* an advantage!)

As I recover from my typical post-semester mental collapse (read: playing the PokÃ©mon video games for 11hrs/day all week), I thought it would be good to reflect on the different stages of my college journey and consider the events that led me to the place I'm at. Buckle up.

### The beginnings

What drew me to OU in the first place? Basically, money. The first big thing to realize about me is that I was not always the shining exemplary student that I obviously am today. In high school, I didn't place much weight on the college admissions process. I didn't totally understand the gravitas of accepting an offer, and I didn't have a comprehensive grasp of the full cost of tuition, loans, and living fees. So, I took it easy. I tossed my hat in the ring with big name schools like Stanford and MIT (wait-listed, technically), but didn't try extremely hard to get in. I didn't even tour anywhere - other than briefly visiting OU for a piano audition. I wanted to both be a therapist and continue playing, so my listed degrees were psychology and piano.

I got an offer from OU, but I kept dragging my feet about accepting. The longer I put it off, the sweeter the deal got. They kept eliminating various costs like the application fee or first-semester fees, so I just kept waiting to see how much money I could save by procrastinating. Finally, the day that responses were due, I formally accepted the offer from OU due to the National Merit scholarship package and acceptance to their piano program.

### The death of the piano dream

To be fair, I technically lasted more than 1 semester as a piano major. After my first juries, my teacher [Dr. John Patrick Murphy](https://www.ou.edu/finearts/music/faculty-staff/john-patrick-murphy) sat me down and asked if I fully understood the standards for daily practice expected of piano majors throughout college (Spoiler: I did not). By your junior/senior year, around 4 hours/day piano practice was expected. Some of my friends (read: [Aidan Sudler](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aidan-sudler-8b57aa204/)) may have been talented enough to exist in such an environment, but I who was struggling to even practice 1hr/day was not. So, I decided to relegate the study of music to a vocal minor, and focus on psychology.

The first year of college also held many non-academic developments that were incredibly impactful. Notably, I discovered a wealth of social connections and amazing friends that uplifted and enriched my freshman year. I started college in 2020: right in the peak of COVID. During this time, most classes were online, and many in-person events were shut down. Luckily, I had groups such as:

* The guys in my dorm hall (Couch 6W)
* The girls on the other side of the dorm floor
* The David L. Boren dorm people
* The guys in Sigma Alpha Mu (Go SAMMY)
* The other music students
* The people in Campus Activities Council
* The people who worked in the Gender + Equality Center

All of these groups were incredibly influential in shaping my first-year college development. Socially, many of the first groups listed helped me feel welcomed and accepted on campus. Professionally, my interaction with the last two groups paved the way for involvement that would occur my sophomore/junior year. 

Many of the first things I did on campus were either for or concerned with the frat [Sigma Alpha Mu](https://sam.org/). As a freshman, I was adamant about not joining a fraternity. I did not have a positive perception of frat guys, and didn't jive with the flavor of masculinity expressed in many greek spaces. However, I probably watched Monsters University too many times, and eventually became curious about greek life. What eventually convinced me to join was the fact that a new fraternity, Sigma Alpha Mu (or Sammy, for short) was getting founded on campus the year that I was rushing. The representative from SAM headquarters who was founding the chapter at OU marketed it as a frat for non-frat-guys, where the founding fathers would get to play a role in shaping a culture in the fraternity that was different from many other houses. I figured this sounded cool, so I joined as a founding father.

One of my favorite things Sammy did together was OU Scandals. Scandals is the name for OU's yearly student-produced musical production (no, the name Scandals didn't result from all of the drama that theatre kids love to make). Each year, various groups (typically fraternities and sororities) self-produce a short, 15-minute musical which is then performed at a large showcase. The cast of each show consists of a pairing of two specific groups (e.g., the sorority Gamma Phi Beta and the fraternity Pi Kappa Alpha), and the directors and leads are individual members from each group. When Sammy did Scandals, we paired with OU Class Council - a student government organization that performs some function I still don't totally understand. I was both one of the artistic directors and one of the leads for our show, so I was tasked with writing some of the music and performing the role of the villain (my favorite song was an evil rendition of "You're Welcome" from Moana). Overall, it was an incredibly fun experience, and I met some great people during the production.

That year, I also joined the leadership team of OUr Mental Health, a club dedicated to raising awareness and providing resources for mental health on campus. One of my personal highlights was facilitating a stress-relieving meditation night for a group of students during dead week. One girl fell asleep, so I consider my meditation facilitation a success.

### The campus life explosion

I still don't know exactly what got into me, but the next two years of my college career were marked by my full immersion into any form of campus involvement I could find. There was a sort of snowball effect: the more things I got involved in, the more opportunities I would hear about. One of the things I love about OU is that many of the programs and events on campus are fully student-led, so there are nearly endless ways to get plugged in.

One of the major organizations I got involved with this year was the Gender + Equality Center (GEC). Holy moly, these people were amazing. All incoming freshmen at OU are required to take a federally-mandated consent training, and I had a great experience with mine. I was a big of a snot-nosed incoming student, and I went into the training expecting to poke fun at it and not take it too seriously. However, the peer-educator moderator (Abby Tow, who later became one of my good friends in the GEC) was phenomenal, and I learned a lot about consent and how it is communicated. So, the next year I interviewed to become a peer educator for the GEC and was eventually accepted.

If I had to pick one organization that helped me develop professionally during my time at OU, it would be the GEC. All of the people I worked with and all of the bosses I had were amazing and really cared about their employees (Bliss Brown, Jerry Lessley, Quan Phan, Crissy Brown, Amber May, Erin Simpson, Ann Schaefer, to name a few). The team of peer educators was full of motivated students and I formed some lasting friendships. Overall, I can't recommend it enough.

Alongside the GEC, I also got involved with Campus Activities Council (CAC). Remember earlier how I mentioned that most of the organizations at OU are student-led? CAC is the main hub for many of the major events, like OU Film Series and OU Concert Series (OU Scandals is also based out of the CAC). During the fall semester, I was an exec member of CAC College Bowl, an organization that hosted a large trivia tournament each year. I got involved with College Bowl because many of the girls I was friends with in the dorms were members, and it was a blast. Much like the GEC, the team of College Bowl exec members was super fun and close-knit, and the process of setting up and hosting the tournament was full of fun ideas and events.

In the spring, I was a vice chair for CAC Fall Family Weekend (FFW): the organization that hosts the yearly family visitation weekend at OU. I was in charge of reaching out to various other organizations to host events during the weekend, but the fantastic FFW chair Sarah Stringfield honestly did most of the work for me. It was fun, but I definitely gained a reputation for slacking off. 8/10.

Finally, I also was a Teaching Assistant to Dr. Jenel Cavazos for Elements of Psychology 1113 and to Stephanie Oakes for First-Year Foundations of Psychology 1002. Being a TA was great fun, and helped me gain experience in the classroom that was not purely being a student. Highlight of TA'ing: when I planned to host a end-of-the-year party for my group in Elements of Psychology, and was told that if I actually hosted an event with alcohol for undergraduates I would get fired and barred from TA'ing again. #TeamMilgramForLyfe

### Research rumblings

Uh oh... you hear that? It's the sound of the typical upperclassman realization that graduation is now sooner than later, and that you should probably figure out a semblance of a plan. Junior year is when I started reevaluating whether or not I actually wanted to be a therapist. It was sort of my "mid-life crisis" of college; I took cognitive psych and wanted to be a cognitive psychologist, I took virtue ethics and wanted to start a philosophy degree, I started working for my first research lab and REALLY wanted to do research. At the end of the day, this is the year that I first took Psych Test & Measurements with Dr. Robert Terry, and you only need read my graduate school application essays to know how pivotal this class was in getting me excited about quant psych. 

My first research experience was working with Dr. Scott Gronlund in the OU Memory Lab. It was very fun! I was in charge of running participants for an experiment that aimed to determine how object memories were stored in the brain. Participants were given a list of items (objects like chairs, tables, lamps, etc.) to memorize, and they were asked to recall if certain inages (other objects) had been present in the list. The catch is that the cue images were either exact replicas of the object or the same TYPE of object (e.g., a lamp) with subtle variations. The theory is that if there was no significant difference in levels of observed change then people were storing objects conceptually rather than as a flashbulb image memory. Cool stuff.

My second research experience, during the spring semester, was working under Dr. Edward Cokely in the OU Decision Psychology Lab. The content was very cool, but I didn't once interact with Dr. Cokely himself. He was completely hands-off with the undergraduates in the lab and tasked his grad students with managing us. I thought that was a little bit over-the-top, and I was sad that I never got to ask him questions about the material. The framework for this lab was that there exists a measure of intelligenceânumeracyâthat is more predictive of good decision making than any other measure of intelligence. What's more: training an individual in numeracy will actually increase their decision-making abilities in every other area of daily life. Woah. This lab was an interesting experience. At the time, I didn't have the vocabulary to express my question, but I wresled with the question of if numeracy really displayed divergent validity from other measured forms of intelligence. I also was never convinced about the methodology for how they determined that numeracy training makes someone a better decision maker overall. In the end, the experience turned sour as I accidentally missed showing up in the lab for a participant during dead week and was asked to step down as an assistant. Shhh! Don't tell the people that read my CV!
