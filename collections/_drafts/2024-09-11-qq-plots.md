This semester, I have the honor of being a teaching assistant for Advanced Undergraduate Statistics. Despite TA'ing for the course, I have never actually taken it myself. Rather, I knew the instructor from research we'd conducted together, and she figured that I was already knowledgable enough in the material to help teach it (oh, if only she knew how inept I actually was). 

One of the consequences of her gracious assumption is that there is a lot of material in class that I have attemped to learn through guerilla tactics, but have not had *formal* training in. As such, we often cover material in class that fills in some basic gap of knowledge that I had not previously known existed.

Other times, we cover material in a more structured manner than I had previously experienced, which is always helpful. Overall, it's been a great way to more fully immerse myself in basic statistical methodology. 

During our last class period, we completed a lab where the students had to work with a dataset and clean it of missing values and outliers. As is common, part of the process of testing for outliers included testing the data for normality. For the purposes of undergraduate statistics, this consisted of generating a histogram of the data and visually assessing it.

The data were the individual means of a 6-item 5-point scale measuring general parenting behaviors from 1 = coercive parenting to 5 = positive parenting. As we can see, the data seem to have a negative skew. While we discussed it in class, I wanted to introduce some of the students to a more formal way of assessing normality: Quantile-Quantile plots.

> A Quantile-Quantile plot (Q-Q plot, for short) is a relatively quick way to assess the normality of a distribution. A Q-Q plot is a scatterplot which plots two sets of quantiles against each other: theoretical vs. sample.
> What is a quantile? Well, a quantile is basically another way to say "percentile." When you plot quantiles, you are plotting the points at which a certain amount of data fall below (50%, 90%, etc). 
> As we know, a z-score can be understood as a [way to normalize data in terms of its standard deviation from the mean](https://www.statisticshowto.com/probability-and-statistics/z-score/). 
> When we plot quantiles, we plot them in terms of their z-score. As such, the x-axis of a Q-Q plot often ranges from around -3 to +3, which gives us a range of data of about 3 standard deviations from the mean. 
> The y-axis of a Q-Q plot is often the numerical value of the data. 
> When we look at a Q-Q plot (shown below), it shows us the *expected* distribution of quantiles (if our data were normal) plotted against our actual sample of data. If our data were perfectly normal, they would follow the expected distribution perfectly linearly. The blue line on the plot below displays this expected relationship. 
> From this, we can evaluate any deviation from the expected line to mean that our data deviates from normality. 
> If this is confusing so far, don't worry. The reason I'm making this post is that it was confusing for me as well.
