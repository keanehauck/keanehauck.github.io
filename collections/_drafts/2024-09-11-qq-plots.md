This semester, I have the honor of being a teaching assistant for Advanced Undergraduate Statistics. Despite TA'ing for the course, I have never actually taken it myself. Rather, I knew the instructor (the fantastic Catherine Bain) from research we'd conducted together, and she figured that I was already knowledgable enough in the material to help teach it (oh, if only she knew how inept I actually was). 

One of the consequences of her gracious assumption is that there is a lot of material in class that I have attemped to learn through guerilla tactics, but have not had *formal* training in. As such, we often cover material in class that fills in some basic gap of knowledge that I had not previously known existed.

Other times, we cover material in a more structured manner than I had previously experienced, which is always helpful. Overall, it's been a great way to more fully immerse myself in basic statistical methodology. 

During our last class period, we completed a lab where the students had to work with a dataset and clean it of missing values and outliers. As is common, part of the process of testing for outliers included testing the data for normality. For the purposes of undergraduate statistics, this consisted of generating a histogram of the data and visually assessing it.

The data were the individual means of a 6-item 5-point scale measuring general parenting behaviors from 1 = coercive parenting to 5 = positive parenting. As we can see, the data seem to have a negative skew. While we discussed it in class, I wanted to introduce some of the students to a more formal way of assessing normality: Quantile-Quantile plots.

> When we plot quantiles, we plot them in terms of their z-score. As such, the x-axis of a Q-Q plot often ranges from around -3 to +3, which gives us a range of data of about 3 standard deviations from the mean. 
> The y-axis of a Q-Q plot is often the numerical value of the data. 
> When we look at a Q-Q plot (shown below), it shows us the *expected* distribution of quantiles (if our data were normal) plotted against our *actual* sample of data. If our data were perfectly normal, they would follow the expected distribution perfectly linearly. The blue line on the plot below displays this expected relationship.

As we can tell from our quick-and-easy Q-Q plot guide, Q-Q plots are useful in assessing the normality of data. Prior to yesterday, this was about the extent of my knowledge of them. However, as I was thinking about them in class, I realized that I didn't fully understand *why* we interpreted them the way we do.

For example, by running a Q-Q plot on the data previously observed (in the histogram), we obtain the following plot:

As we can see, our data deviate from the expected distribution. Notably, our scatterplot shows a curve, which (apparently) means that our data is skewed. But, why?

I realized that I had no real knowledge of the theoretical basis for Q-Q plot intrepretation. Part of this problem originates from the fact that online materials for learning about Q-Q plots *suck*. Most online sources do a great job of explaining what a Q-Q plot is, but fail to delve into proper interpretation. For example, [this website](https://www.learningtree.com/blog/interpret-q-q-plot/) explains very well what they are, but simply lists the different possibilities for Q-Q plot outcomes. Even UVA (a school I'm applying to), on [their website](https://library.virginia.edu/data/articles/understanding-q-q-plots), don't explain why we see differences between curved plots and extremity-deviated plots. 

So, I asked Catherine, who ended up being a great help. One key part of intrepreting a Q-Q plot, I realized, is thinking about it in terms of individual data points. Take a closer look at the previous graph:

![QQ Plot](/images/posts/qq-plots/qqhighlighted.png "this color scheme brought to you by Christmas")

Let's think about what the data point circled in red is communicating. On the x-axis, we have our theorized z-scores for perfectly normal data. On the y-axis, we can see that the point's value is around ~1.2. So, what the heck does this mean? Well, can see that the point is distant from the line. Now consider what the line is telling us: the *expected* relationship between our data and the normal distribution. So, we can imagine our line extending all the way past the left side of the graph, like so:

![QQ Plot](/images/posts/qq-plots/qqextended.png "Not to scale")

From this, we can see that if our line continued, we would expect to see the value of 1.2 at approximately a z-score of -5. Because our score of 1.2 is currently sitting at around a -3 z-score, this means that it is occurring at a frequency about 2 standard deviations higher than expected. Thus, it (and all the scores under the curve around it) are observed more than we would expect from a typical normal distribution.

How do we synthesize this with our understanding of normality? Well, this highlights another problem with how normal distributions and skew are communicated. Most diagrams of skewed data vs. normal data that I've seen look something like this:
