So I was thinking about something as I fell asleep last night. I was reading about the environmental conditions of Venus—surprise: it's incredibly hazardous and unsuitable for life. At sea level, the atmospheric pressure is about 93x that of Earth, and the temperature averages around [850 °F](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus#Atmosphere_and_climate). Obviously any human that found themselves transported to the surface of Venus would be immediately obliterated. But this begs the question—what planets in the solar system are the most hospitable to human life? The least?

Thus I came up with an idea for a challenge. If I hypothetically had access to unlimited materials and a year's worth of time, how difficult would it be for me to build a contraption that would allow me to survive on each planet in the solar system for 24 hours? I'm going to step through my process of hypothetical survival and rank each planet in terms of its survivability.

### Ground rules

A few basic rules are in order.

* It's assumed that I *can* eventually build each contraption.

Obviously I know nothing about building random machines. However, with unlimited access to materials (including money) and a full calendar year, I would be able to contract with different manufacturing companies to theoretically construct whatever I wanted. We could also just assume that I had a giant 3D printer that could spit out whatever machine I wanted. Either way, this is the least interesting part of the challenge so I'm just going to make it a given.

* The contraptions need to be as simple as possible.

It's totally uninteresting to just surround myself with a 1000-foot thick ball of steel and plop it on the surface of some random planet[^According to the [heat equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_diffusivity) a 1000-foot thick ball of steel will definitely maintain a stable interior temperature for 24 hours. However, we can do better. The thermal diffusivity chart on wikipedia suggests that steel is a rather poor medium for our giant ball. Rubber actually fares really well, followed by glass.] Therefore, the challenge is as interesting as possible if our goal is to make a simple, exposed contraption.

* My contraption and I will be teleported to surface level of the planet (if it has a surface)

Similarly to the last point, it's kind of cheating to say I can just float 5 miles above the surface, where no storms/gravity/temperatures can reach me. At the logical extreme, what's to stop me from just orbiting a planet for 24h? This rule ensures I have to at least survive at a reasonable altitude. If the planet is a gas giant like Jupiter, we'll discuss what seems fair as we get to it.

Ok, those are the rules! I'll go through the ranking from most survivable to least survivable.

### 1. Mars

Perhaps the biggest shock of this entire ranking is that Earth isn't the most survivable planet. The crux of the matter boils down to this: Earth has surface water, while [Mars does not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars). I have to account for the fact that about [71% of Earth's surface is covered with water](https://www.usgs.gov/water-science-school/science/how-much-water-there-earth), so if I'm teleported to a random location at surface level there's a good chance I end up in one of the oceans. Mars, on the other hand, is predictable. Most of its surface is dry, cold, and rocky, which makes it much simpler to figure out how to survive. NASA has [developed theoretical suits for walking on Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_suit) and they have oxygen tanks rated for longer than 24 hours, so all I would need to do is contact NASA to build one for me and train me how to use it. Not only is it totally survivable (barring suit malfunctions), but this scenario might end up being the coolest trip of my entire life: walking around Mars and exploring the red landscape for 24 hours. Unbelievably, the biggest issue might be how I would use the bathroom.

### 2. Earth

Mother Earth really let us down here. If I could pick and choose the location I'm being teleported to, there would be [no problem at all](https://www.daveandbusters.com/us/en/about/locations/canada-vaughan/). Factoring for the oceans creates some problems. My contraption could be a cruise ship, but is this necessary? I think we can do this without even needing a boat of any sort. The [SOLAS standards](https://www.xingdunmarine.net/life-jackets/solas-inflatable-life-jacket/) for life jacket buoyancy require them to lose less than 5% buoyancy over the span of 24 hours, so we're all good there. The bigger threat would be the temperature. A [large percentage](https://www.ospo.noaa.gov/data/sst/contour/global_small.c.gif) of the ocean has temperatures below freezing, so I would need to bundle up. We could get technical with the temperature ratings of different wetsuits, but I think there's an easier solution. 

![divingsuit](/images/posts/planet-survival/divingsuit.jpg)

An [atmospheric diving suit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_diving_suit#Current_suits) has just about everything I'd need to survive 24h in the ocean: thruster maneuverability, a maintained internal atmospheric pressure/temperature, and a 24-hour emergency backup oxygen tank. So, I'd just secure a bunch of life jackets to one of those suits. If the lifejackets fail, I should be able to jet around with the thrusters to avoid getting too deep. I can also use my year of time to learn how to maneuver my suit. And in the off-chance I get teleported to land, I can just walk around in my modern suit of armor to avoid any natural predators. Easy survival.
