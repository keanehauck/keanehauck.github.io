### Ah, Coffee.

A simple Google search (have we gotten to a point in society where I don't have to capitalize google?) reveals a plethora of guides for how to order and drink your coffee. As someone who was raised without both caffine and manners, the wild world of Italian coffee has always intimidated me. Hell, I would be lying if I said even Starbucks didn't intimidate me from time to time. What exactly is a macchiato, anyways?

This past month, I set a goal to immerse myself into the coffee sphere.
