### Ah, Coffee.

A simple Google search (have we gotten to a point in society where I don't have to capitalize google?) reveals a plethora of guides for how to order and drink your coffee. As someone who was raised without both caffeine and manners, the wild world of Italian coffee has always intimidated me. Hell, I would be lying if I said even Starbucks didn't intimidate me from time to time. What exactly is a macchiato, anyways?

This past month, I set a goal to immerse myself into the coffee sphere. The observant reader might wonder why someone would want to begin a hobby that would most likely result in a chemical dependency. The answer to that question, dear reader, is _history_. I took a course titled Great Books of Western Civilization last semester, and my professor was somewhat of a polymath. Throughout the course, he would wax eloquent about whatever period of history we were currently covering, and he seemed to always have some special tidbit of information that would stick in my head. One class, when we were studying the Enlightenment, things were proceeding as normal - discussing Hobbes, Locke, and the like. However, right in the middle of discussion, my professor offhandedly remarked, "You know, some people think the Enlightenment was caused by the proliferation of caffeine throughout Europe. The switch to stimulants from depressants might have inspired so much scientific and artistic thought."

Wait, what? Back up. I'd never been a coffee person, and this sentiment is making it out to be some sort of super-drink. Am I handicapping myself in my academic journey by not ingesting caffeine? 

After some thought, I realized that the answer was a resounding no. But _c'mon_, you look so sophisticated when you sit there with a cappuccino. I was in.

### Common Drinks

The first thing you realize when you walk into a caf√© is that Starbucks has not well-prepared you to order coffee. I have a really bad habit of googling (again, the capitalization) things in front of me instead of experiencing them for myself, so I spent a few minutes during my inaugural voyage to a coffee shop researching what the different drinks were. Woah. Why were some of them so small?

So, Italian coffee drinks are all espresso-based, meaning that they have a stronger and more-concentrated base than typical coffee.
