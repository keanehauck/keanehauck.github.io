Hello! If you were expecting a traditional blog post from this week's/month's/year's (choose whichever word fits the impression you have of me and my scheduling) installment, I apologize. In lieu of an actual post, here are a few short stories I wrote last summer while working for Comcast. All were written in the back of a Jeep.

Please email me separately if you have any desire to read a 22-page unfinished religious critique or a 3-page unfinished guide on how to cable-map. According to my digging, I did a lot of writing last year.
