I recently turned 22, and alongside [other phenomenal birthday gifts I received](https://imgur.com/a/gGPzWlR) my brother got me a Professional Killstreak Australium Medi Gun.

What is that, you ask? Well, let me enlighten you. The Medi Gun is a weapon from one of the most masterfully-crafted video games to ever grace humanity with its presence: Team Fortress 2 (and an Australium one is simply a cool-looking and expensive golden version of the same weapon). I have played Team Fortress 2 (TF2) since I was in middle school, and this game has somehow found a foothold in my life no matter the circumstances I find myself in. As a child, its casual appeal gave me hours of sitting around laughing at funny-looking taunts and gamemodes. As an adolescent, its trade economy gave me a way to try and make a little bit of money and barter for better and better items. Finally, when I was a bit older and gaming became a more competitive and serious hobby, it functioned as a fantastic platform for competition with an extremely competent and experienced playerbase. As I am currently in one of the inevitable phases where TF2 recaptures my attention and pulls me towards the competitive scene for a few months, I wanted to provide a rundown of exactly what is behind a competitive TF2 match, and, by extension, why I love this game so much. 

## The History of TF2

TF2 was originally released for PC in 2007 by Valve. It was developed as a sequel to Team Fortress Classic, a mod for the popular first-person shooter game Quake. TF2 comprises 9 classes (or mercenaries) that the player can play as, each containing their own playstyle alongside individual strengths and weaknesses.

*The nine classes of TF2*

Players join one of TF2's two teams, RED or BLU, and try to defeat the other team. Pretty self-explanatory, right? This basic premise underscores the entirety of competitive TF2: defeat the other team. Despite appearing very simple, however, the complexities involved behind the strategic decisions of an individual team are almost endless. Let's first dive into the classes used in a competitive match to gain a slightly more comprehensive framework.

## TF2's Classes

TF2's competitive scene has always been unofficial, as Valve only released an in-game competitive mode in 2016 (nine years after the game's original release). As such, it is driven by passionate community members who formulate the type of game that they want to partake in. There are two main modes of competitive TF2: Sixes and Highlander. Remember how I mentioned there was a total of nine classes in the game? Well, the majority of these classes are generally less powerful/useful/ubiquitious than a select few, and players were quick to realize this. As such, in Sixes (which is the main format of competitive), only four different classes are used. The other mode, Highlander, is played between teams of nine players, one of each class. However, this mode is generally less popular than Sixes and viewed as less competitive (albeit possibly more true to the *nature* of TF2). Let's dive into the classes used in a traditional Sixes match.

### Scout

</p>

The scout class is generally considered to be the duelist class, with a sort of [glass cannon](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/glass_cannon#) playstyle. Scouts have 125 health, the lowest of any class. However, they possess the fastest move speed of any class, and can double-jump in midair. The main weapon they use is a scattergun, which is a 6-shot close range shotgun. They are unique in that they are the only class in Sixes to primarily rely on a hitscan (where bullets do not have an in-game travel time) weapon: the other 3 classes in a Sixes match use weapons with a projectile delay. Combined with their double-jump, this gives scouts an edge in any 1v1 scenario, as they have the damage and mobility to outclass most other mercenaries. A typical Sixes team contains two scouts.

### Soldier

</p>

Soldier is probably the most versatile class in the game. Depending on the playstyle, soldier can range from a high-mobility disruption class to a damage-outputting tank. The main weapon for soldiers is a 4-shot rocket launcher, a projectile weapon that does very high damage at close range. Soldiers have 200 health and walk slowly; however, they get mobility through other means. The most critically-important facet of the rocket launcher is the ability to *rocket jump* with it: a technique where a soldier shoots at the ground near their own feet and uses the knockback to propel them through the air. Rocket jumping is one of the most important movement techniques in gaming history, and allows players to reach [unbelievable levels of mobility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAEOiIF8Piw). The high-damage capabilities of soldier combined with his map-wide mobility allow him to function as an assassin class that can quickly jump in and assassinate a select target. Sixes teams run 2 soldiers at almost all times. 

### Demoman

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/posts/tf2-strategy/demoman.png" />
</p>

Demoman is the heavy-hitter of the bunch. He uses 2 main weapons: the grenade launcher and the stickybomb launcher. Grenades are very difficult to hit, but do massive damage regardless of range. Stickybombs are much easier to hit, and do damage in a wide range. Both weapons are extremely useful for controlling specific areas, making it very difficult to advance on the enemy team while a demoman is alive. Demoman has 175 health and a slightly slower movement speed than average, but he can also jump with his stickybomb launcher, giving him additional mobility. 

The stickybomb launcher warrants closer inspection. This weapon is probably the singularly most important weapon in a Sixes game, and for good reason. Stickybombs (or stickies) do not detonate on hit; rather, they are detonated by the player. This allowes for a demoman to place "traps" where the stickies are hidden and detonated when a player walks over them, killing them instantly. When the weapon isn't being used for traps, stickies can be detonated in the air, dealing damage in a wide range. The weapon has a clip of 8 stickies, and shoots projectiles in an arc-shaped pattern. By holding down the fire button, a demoman can adjust how far they want to shoot a sticky. This gives them potency at an extremely large breadth of ranges: something that the other classes fail to accomplish. Demoman is the reason why mobility is so important for the other classes: if you're just walking around aimlessly, a good demoman will obliterate you. Sixes teams are restricted to only one demoman at a time.

### Medic

<p align="center">

</p>

The final Sixes class is medic. Medic plays the role of healing the rest of the team with his Medi Gun and healing crossbow. Medic has 150 health and a fast move-speed, albeit not as fast as a scout. 

It would be an understatement to call medic powerful. Without a medic, a team is effectively crippled. Scouts and demoman can do chip damage at far range, meaning that the un-healed team is prevented from even reaching the fight at full power. Additionally, medic possesses 2 abilities that change the flow of an entire game:
* Overheal. When healing a target at full health, medics can give them extra health equal to 50% of their total maximum health. So, a fully-overhealed soldier goes from 200 health to 300. Needless to say, overhealing a player gives them a massive advantage in any 1v1 or fight they might be in. A fully overhealed team engaging with a non-overhealed team should win every time.
* ÃœberCharge (I will not be using the umlaut for the rest of this post, but I wanted to use it at least once). Ubercharge (or Uber) is medic's special ability that allows him to make his heal target invincible for 8 seconds. In a fast-paced game such as TF2, invincibility is nothing to sneeze at. An invincible demoman jumping straight into your team is an unconditional recipe for destruction. Each medic possesses an Uber meter that charges by healing players. When the meter reaches 100%, they will be able to use their Ubercharge. It takes around a minute to build an Uber, and this rate is influenced by how consistently the medic is healing. 
These two abilities of medic mean that the entire meta of competitive TF2 revolves around keeping your medic alive. If you have Uber and the enemy team doesn't, you are almost guaranteed to win the fight, and vice versa. At the macro level, team strategy is structured around maintaining Uber advantage above the enemy team, but I will discuss this later. Sixes only allows one medic per team, for obvious reasons. 

## Movement

Before addressing the individual micro strategies that go into specific fights, it's important to better understand movement as a whole in TF2.
