What does every great statistician need the ability to do? If you answered *easily explain complicated theorems* or *derive complex formulae by hand*, you are incorrect. The true answer is that every stats person needs to be able to draw Greek letters on a whiteboard without them looking like scribbly blobs.

This is something I am unsurprisingly bad at. To help myself (and hopefully share this knowledge with others), I've compiled a list of Greek letters and how to draw them. With the hefty assistance of some LLMs, I created a rainbow sketchpad that shows the direction of a line through its color (red $\rightarrow$ purple). So, as you browse through the list of letters, you can tell in which direction the pen stroke should start when handwriting. You can also have fun experimenting with the sketchpad below:

<iframe 
  id="rainbowFrame"
  src="/images/posts/greek-letters/rainbow-draw.html" 
  width="100%" 
  style="border:none; overflow:hidden;" 
  scrolling="no">
</iframe>

<script>
window.addEventListener("message", (ev) => {
  if (ev.data && ev.data.type === "resize-iframe") {
    const iframe = document.getElementById("rainbowFrame");
    if (iframe) iframe.style.height = ev.data.height + "px";
  }
});
</script>

### The Greek Alphabet

If we get the term *alphabet* from the Greek system, do we really need to clarify that we're using the Greek alphabet? Technically, we should be calling our system the "English Alphabet."

Here's a list of all the letters and how I write them. As a disclaimer, these depictions are gotten from use in mathematics or statistics, not everyday handwriting. So, some of them might be needlessly complex or not follow convention.

alpha: I used to draw it starting from the bottom, but starting from the top seems to give it a "fuller" circle 

lzeta: I have no clue how to write this one, really. I don't think i've ever used it

ueta: I think the slant makes it look more "Greek."

uiota: Tough one.

lkappa: I like to put a little tail at the top of the main stroke to distinguish it from a "k".

llambda: halflife

lnu: again, the slight curve distinguishes it from a "v."

uxi: WTF is this thing?

lxi: the most feared of them all. Known far and wide by matrix algebrists. It's not too bad if you think of it as lzeta with an extra loop

omicrons: Yippee! Easy

upi: Looks like a torii

ltau: Curve to distinguish

uphi: Sometimes serifs are used at the top and bottom to distinguish from the lowercase phi

upsi: Serif on the right side (and size) distinguish it from the lowercase
