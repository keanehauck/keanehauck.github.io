### Continue at ye own peril...

I recently turned 22, and alongside [other phenomenal birthday gifts I received](https://imgur.com/a/gGPzWlR) my brother got me a Professional Killstreak Australium Medi Gun.

What is that, you ask? Well, let me enlighten you. The Medi Gun is a weapon from one of the most masterfully-crafted video games to ever grace humanity with its presence: **Team Fortress 2** (and an Australium one is simply a cool-looking and expensive golden version of the same weapon). I have played Team Fortress 2 (TF2) since I was in middle school, and this game has somehow found a foothold in my life no matter the circumstances I find myself in. As a child, its casual appeal gave me hours of sitting around laughing at funny-looking taunts and gamemodes. As an adolescent, its trade economy gave me a way to try and make a little bit of money and barter for better and better items. Finally, when I was a bit older and gaming became a more competitive and serious hobby, it functioned as a fantastic platform for competition with an extremely competent and experienced playerbase. After 3000 hours of this game, I consider myself somewhat well-prepared to speak on the strategies that players utilize (this isn't me being modest: some people I play with have *tens of thousands* of hours of experience). As I am currently in one of the inevitable phases where TF2 recaptures my attention and pulls me towards the competitive scene for a few months, I wanted to provide a rundown of exactly what is behind a competitive TF2 match, and, by extension, why I love this game so much. 

## The History of TF2

TF2 was originally released for PC in 2007 by Valve. It was developed as a sequel to Team Fortress Classic, a mod for the popular first-person shooter game Quake. TF2 comprises 9 classes (or mercenaries) that the player can play as, each containing their own playstyle alongside individual strengths and weaknesses.

*The nine classes of TF2*

Players join one of TF2's two teams, RED or BLU, and try to defeat the other team. Pretty self-explanatory, right? This basic premise underscores the entirety of competitive TF2: defeat the other team. Despite appearing very simple, however, the complexities involved behind the strategic decisions of an individual team are almost endless. Let's first dive into the classes used in a competitive match to gain a slightly more comprehensive framework.

## TF2's Classes

TF2's competitive scene has always been unofficial, as Valve only released an in-game competitive mode in 2016 (nine years after the game's original release). As such, it is driven by passionate community members who formulate the type of game that they want to partake in. There are two main modes of competitive TF2: Sixes and Highlander. Remember how I mentioned there was a total of nine classes in the game? Well, the majority of these classes are generally less powerful/useful/ubiquitious than a select few, and players were quick to realize this. As such, in Sixes (which is the main format of competitive), only four different classes are used. The other mode, Highlander, is played between teams of nine players, one of each class. However, this mode is generally less popular than Sixes and viewed as less competitive (albeit possibly more true to the *nature* of TF2). Let's dive into the classes used in a traditional Sixes match.

### Scout

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/posts/tf2-strategy/scout.png" />
</p>

The scout class is generally considered to be the duelist class, with a sort of [glass cannon](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/glass_cannon#) playstyle. Scouts have 125 health, the lowest of any class. However, they possess the fastest move speed of any class, and can double-jump in midair. The main weapon they use is a scattergun, which is a 6-shot close range shotgun. They are unique in that they are the only class in Sixes to primarily rely on a hitscan (where bullets do not have an in-game travel time) weapon: the other 3 classes in a Sixes match use weapons with a projectile delay. Combined with their double-jump, this gives scouts an edge in any 1v1 scenario, as they have the damage and mobility to outclass most other mercenaries. A typical Sixes team contains two scouts.

### Soldier

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/posts/tf2-strategy/soldier.png" />
</p>

Soldier is probably the most versatile class in the game. Depending on the playstyle, soldier can range from a high-mobility disruption class to a damage-outputting tank. The main weapon for soldiers is a 4-shot rocket launcher, a projectile weapon that does very high damage at close range. Soldiers have 200 health and walk slowly; however, they get mobility through other means. The most critically-important facet of the rocket launcher is the ability to *rocket jump* with it: a technique where a soldier shoots at the ground near their own feet and uses the knockback to propel them through the air. Rocket jumping is one of the most important movement techniques in gaming history, and allows players to reach [unbelievable levels of mobility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAEOiIF8Piw). The high-damage capabilities of soldier combined with his map-wide mobility allow him to function as an assassin class that can quickly jump in and assassinate a select target. Sixes teams run 2 soldiers at almost all times. 

### Demoman

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/posts/tf2-strategy/demoman.png" />
</p>

Demoman is the heavy-hitter of the bunch. He uses 2 main weapons: the grenade launcher and the stickybomb launcher. Grenades are very difficult to hit, but do massive damage regardless of range. Stickybombs are much easier to hit, and do damage in a wide range. Both weapons are extremely useful for controlling specific areas, making it very difficult to advance on the enemy team while a demoman is alive. Demoman has 175 health and a slightly slower movement speed than average, but he can also jump with his stickybomb launcher, giving him additional mobility. 

The stickybomb launcher warrants closer inspection. This weapon is probably the singularly most important weapon in a Sixes game, and for good reason. Stickybombs (or stickies) do not detonate on hit; rather, they are detonated by the player. This allowes for a demoman to place "traps" where the stickies are hidden and detonated when a player walks over them, killing them instantly. When the weapon isn't being used for traps, stickies can be detonated in the air, dealing damage in a wide range. The weapon has a clip of 8 stickies, and shoots projectiles in an arc-shaped pattern. By holding down the fire button, a demoman can adjust how far they want to shoot a sticky. This gives them potency at an extremely large breadth of ranges: something that the other classes fail to accomplish. Demoman is the reason why mobility is so important for the other classes: if you're just walking around aimlessly, a good demoman will obliterate you. Sixes teams are restricted to only one demoman at a time.

### Medic

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/posts/tf2-strategy/medic.png" />
</p>

The final Sixes class is medic. Medic plays the role of healing the rest of the team with his Medi Gun and healing crossbow. He has 150 health and a fast move-speed, albeit not as fast as a scout. 

It would be an understatement to call medic powerful. Without a medic, a team is effectively crippled. Scouts and demoman can do chip damage at far range, meaning that the un-healed team is prevented from even reaching the fight at full power. Additionally, medic possesses 2 abilities that change the flow of an entire game:
* Overheal. When healing a target at full health, medics can give them extra health equal to 50% of their total maximum health. So, a fully-overhealed soldier goes from 200 health to 300. Needless to say, overhealing a player gives them a massive advantage in any 1v1 or fight they might be in. A fully overhealed team engaging with a non-overhealed team should win every time.
* ÃœberCharge (I will not be using the umlaut for the rest of this post, but I wanted to use it at least once). Ubercharge (or Uber) is medic's special ability that allows him to make his heal target invincible for 8 seconds. In a fast-paced game such as TF2, invincibility is nothing to sneeze at. An invincible demoman jumping straight into your team is an unconditional recipe for destruction. Each medic possesses an Uber meter that charges by healing players. When the meter reaches 100%, they will be able to use their Ubercharge. It takes around a minute to build an Uber, and this rate is influenced by how consistently the medic is healing (additionally, healing injured players builds uber quicker, which leads to a strategy where players will intentionally hurt themselves to let their medic get uber faster: known as *building*).

These two abilities of medic mean that the entire meta of competitive TF2 revolves around keeping your medic alive. If you have Uber and the enemy team doesn't, you are almost guaranteed to win the fight, and vice versa. At the macro level, team strategy is structured around maintaining Uber advantage above the enemy team, but I will discuss this later. Sixes only allows one medic per team, for obvious reasons. 

## Duel Micro-strategy

Scout, soldier, and demo compose the classes that do most of the fighting in a match. While TF2 is a team-based game, there are moments throughout the course of the match where two players might find themselves engaged in a duel (one player fighting one other player). If they are performed between the last two players in a fight, or executed in certain other criteria, duels can be pivotal in swinging the tide of a match. Before we address the roles that each class plays in a team fight, let's first delve into the strategies that are invoked if each class finds themself engaged in a 1-on-1 duel with each of the other classes.

### Scout vs. Scout

A scout duel is where we first get a peek into how important one's movement is (arguably more important than aiming skill). Scout's scattergun does up to 110 damage from a point-blank meatshot (a shot where all bullets hit the enemy), and so a scout duel can be decided by one well-placed shot. Because of this, there are a plethora of different movement-based strategies and techniques that revolve around making it difficult for your opponent to line up that perfect shot. In TF2, individual movement to the left and right is known as *strafing*. Generally, you want to move with intent behind each strafe you make, and utilizing strafing properly can make you harder to hit while simultaneously making it easier to hit your opponent. Here are a few of the common techniques used in a scout duel:
* Mirroring: strafing to the left when your opponent strafes to the left, and strafing to the right when your opponent strafes to the right. Perfectly-excecuted mirror strafing makes it so that, from your frame of reference, your opponent is technically not moving at all. This makes it much easier to line up shots, allowing for an easier kill. However, this does come with the downside of also giving your opponent the same advantage. If your opponent is unaware you are mirror strafing, and attempting to line up shots by predicting extraneous movement, they are likely to miss, but if they are aware you are mirror strafing, it eliminates your advantage in the duel. 
* Anti-mirroring: strafing to the left when your opponent strafes to the right, and vice versa. This pattern of strafing increases the angle between you and your opponent, making aiming more difficult, and in turn makes you more difficult to hit. On an extremely micro level, the player prepared for anti-mirroring can use it to assist their aim by positioning their crosshair on the side of the opponent they expect them to move into. Thus, when their opponent strafes to one side and the player strafes to the side opposite, their crosshair will be pulled into their opponent, as they are moving contrary to each other. This makes the mechanical movement of aiming require less effort, and their shots line up automatically. 
* Dodging: moving in a manner that completely prioritizes avoidability without regard for hitting shots oneself. By utilizing visual cues and erratic patterns of movement, a skilled scout can make it likely that their opponent will miss. Dodging also contains a visual element, as hitscan weapons in TF2 have visual bullet tracers that players can use to see where their opponent is shooting. Scouts can use this information to determine the best way to move to make aiming difficult for their opponent. If you can see that their aim is trailing behind your strafe, continue your strafe to maximize the amount of time that their crosshair is off you. If their shots are hitting you, change your strafe direction to force them to readjust their mouse movement. 

Knowing when and how to utilize a combination of these tactics can make a good scout an absolute monster to face in a 1v1. For a good example of dodging using these tactics, check out [this clip from a guide on scout deathmatch theory I recently watched](https://youtu.be/bEEZ2P6HPNg?si=Bd4425uNnWBOV9GE&t=206). The scout that has the best movement will typically win the 1v1.

### Scout vs. Soldier

This duel is where we can see the importance of positioning really come into play. In a vaccuum, scout has the clear advantage. Scout's double-jump becomes a critical dodging tool in this fight, as it allows him to change course mid-air to avoid a soldier's rockets. Soldier's one tool to consistently hit the scout is splash damage: when he hits the floor, the explosion radius of the rocket can often catch scouts who are attempting to dodge. However, by maximizing the time in the air, scouts make it more difficult for soldiers to rely on splash damage. However, if soldier has the positioning advantage, this whole story changes.

Having the high ground is important for all classes, but soldier feels the advantages the most. Consider the following example from the perspective of a soldier:

![High ground](/images/posts/tf2-strategy/highground.jpg)

From this angle, projectiles become much easier to hit, and splash damage becomes much more important in catching enemies. When a scout jumps up to avoid splash damage, it brings him closer to the soldier, making it easier for the soldier to line up his next shot. Similarly, it becomes impossible for a soldier to miss a rocket by firing it "past" the opponent. In a normal duel, scouts can avoid rockets by jumping closer to the soldier to make the splash damage hit the ground behind them. When the soldier has the high ground, however, the rockets will all impact the ground at the level of the scout. 

![Low ground](/images/posts/tf2-strategy/lowground.jpg)

The player on the low ground is also disadvantaged in that it becomes harder to hit their opponent. In this example, the hitbox of the player on the high ground is only half-visible, making them a smaller targer. Additionally, the player on the high ground can utilize dodging "behind" the cover of the high ground whenever they wish, giving them the ability to choose when they want to open themselves up to damage. 

The scout vs. soldier duel is a strategic one, with each class attempting to move the duel into an environment that most benefits them. 

### Scout vs. Demoman

This is probably the most one-sided duel in a Sixes match. Unlike the soldier, demoman does not have any splash damage for his grenades, so he has to hit the scout directly for them to be effective. Stickies are similarly problematic, as their charge-up time before detonation makes them predictable for a skilled scout to avoid. The task of a demoman is to use his explosive capabilities to wall out the scout before the scout can close the gap between them. If the scout gets in close proximity, the demo is usually dead. 

### Other Duels

Most of the other duels contain variations of the strategies found in the previously listed matchups. Soldier vs. soldier is determined by who hits the most accurate rockets, demo vs. demo is determined by who hits the most accurate stickies. If either of them has the high ground, they typically win. Soldier vs. demo is interesting in that it is decided similarly to scout vs. demoman. If the soldier can use his high mobility to close the gap between him and the demoman, he can usually use his high burst damage to outmatch his opponent. These duels highlight an important fact about demoman: despite being the best class at controlling choke points in a map, demo is the worst class for duelling. 

It almost goes without saying that any damage class will demolish medic in a 1v1. This is an intentional part of game balance and adds an additional layer of strategy to the game. If you, as a lone scout, encounter a medic and a soldier, what should you do? Killing the medic is the most important part of the engagement, but do you risk trying to pick him off before the soldier gets you? Or do you attempt to defeat an overhealed soldier so that you can finish off the medic? Questions such as these arise frequently throughout the course of a match, adding strategy to arena-style duels.

## Team Composition and Roles

I've danced around the composition of a Sixes team throughout the post, but here it is in its entirety: 2 scouts, 2 soldiers, 1 demoman, and 1 medic.

As I've mentioned previously, these classes stand above the other 5 in terms of power level, and so they form the basis for competitive strategy. What makes them powerful? Well, in TF2, mobility is king. The other 5 classes lack the movement abilities of scout's double-jump and run speed alongside the explosion jumping of soldier and demo. Mobility allows a class to choose when they want to engage in a duel: if they find themself in a disadvantageous situation, they have the option of attempting to escape. The other classes, on the other hand, are sitting ducks. Similarly, speedy classes make a speedy team. The ability to mobilize your team to whatever part of the battlefield is best for the fight you find yourselves in is incredibly helpful. 

Let's take a closer look into the specific roles that the classes play on a team.

Each team is composed of 2 parts: the *combo* and the *flank*. Generally, the combo comprises the medic, the demo, a scout, and sometimes a soldier. Each competitive TF2 map contains a main pathway to each point, known as "choke," and a flank route. The combo's job is to watch the choke and prevent the enemy combo from pushing through; or, if the enemy team rotates to flank, their job is to rotate with them in order to prevent them from pushing. Each team's flank, which is 1 scout and 1 soldier, is tasked with information-spotting and guarding the entrance that the combo is not watching. 

Under this framework, despite teams having 2 scouts and 2 soldiers, each player performs an individual role. The scout that sticks with the combo is known as the pocket scout, and the scout that stays on the flank is called the flank scout. Similarly, the combo soldier is known as the pocket (no *soldier* in the name), while the flank soldier gets a special title: the *roamer*. 

I'll provide a brief overview of the different responsibilities each role performs for a team:

**Pocket scout**
* Protects the medic from enemy soldiers
* Builds uber with the medic with the use of a melee weapon that hurts the user
* Provides movement speed to the medic (when a medic heals a scout, the medic gains movement speed equal to the scout)
* Participates in the uber push alongside the demoman
* *Maincalls*: verbally commands the positioning and strategy of the rest of the team

**Flank scout**
* Patrols the flank alongside the roamer
* Picks off out-of-position enemies
* Captures control points
* Cleans up kills during teamfights

**Pocket**
* Protects the medic
* Spams fire at chokepoints alongside the demoman to prevent enemy team pushes
* Outputs consistent damage on called targets
* Assists the roamer in "bombing" (rocket-jumping directly onto the enemy team to deal massive damage and eliminate key targets such as the medic)

**Roamer**
* Suicide-bombs the enemy team to attempt to kill the medic or get him to use uber prematurely to save his life
* Watches the flank alongside the flank scout
* Makes space and distracts by rocket-jumping through and behind the enemy team
* Generally act as an assassin

**Demoman**
* Spams chokepoints to prevent the enemy from pushing
* Deals huge amount of damage in a wide area
* Arrives first at most team fights
* Primary target for ubercharge
* Lays sticky traps in key areas for point denial

**Medic**
* Heals teammates
* Overheals key targets for bombing / survivability
* Builds and uses ubercharge
* Maincalls alongside the pocket scout
* Tracks the enemy uber percentage

In analyzing the responsibilities of each role, we can see how critical the medic is for each team. A large percentage of the responsibilies for each role (and almost an entire role itself in roamer) are dedicated simply to either killing the enemy medic or ensuring the survivability of one's own. 

## Macro-level strategies

Now might be a good time to describe exactly how a match is won. Each Sixes match is played on TF2 maps that contain a total of 5 control points. Each match is divided into rounds normally played as first to 5 wins, and each round is won when one team captures all 5 points. When the round starts, each team has 2 points already captured, and the control point in the middle is up for grabs. Thus, the first fight in the round occurs on this middle point. 

### Mid

This first fight, known as "Mid," is critically important for determining the flow of the rest of the game. If team A wipes the entire enemy team B on mid without suffering any losses of their own, team A normally has enough time to capture the 2nd point before the enemy team respawns as well as build uber before the enemy medic can prevent their push into last. If such a catastrophic mid is allowed to happen, the round is usually over. Conversely, if a team loses the mid fight but manages to escape with the majority of their players and their medic alive, they are now in a position of playing defense on their 2nd point, which is a much more advantageous state to be in. If a fight is lost on 2nd while both teams use uber, the losing team normally has time to respawn and hold their last point (known as "last") while building uber at the same rate as the enemy team. 

One of the reasons why holding last and holding 2nd after a lost mid fight are considered to be reasonable and successful positions for your team to be in relates to the concept of *defender's advantage*. When a team is defending a point rather than attacking, there are multiple factors that swing the fight in their favor. For example, the attacking team must first close the gap between themselves and the defending team in order to initiate a fight, either by pushing through a chokepoint or jumping players in. Because of this, the attacking team is much more susceptible to spam damage, leading to the attacking team needing to use uber first in an even exchange. Additionally, TF2 map geometry is such that a defending team can normally set up on the high ground to have the positional advantage before the fight even begins. 

This is why getting to mid first is so important: it gives you defender's advantage in an otherwise even fight.

At the end of the day, TF2 is a shooter game. And what better to highlight in a shooter game than some shots.
