### I'm an amateur quantitative methodologist, computer scientist, and chess connoisseur (I had to look up how to spell that word). Welcome to my website! 

<br>

### Here, you can find links to my research, blog, and contact information. Please keep in mind that this website is a work in progress, and there may be multiple placeholder links!

Currently, I'm an undergraduate student studying Psychology at the University of Oklahoma. I conduct research utilizing factor analysis and machine learning with an applied focus in AI usage among college students and student retention patterns. Faculty I've worked closely with include Dr. Jenel Cavazos, Dr. Robert Terry, Dr. Lauren Grimley, and Dr. Eric Day. Thank you to all of those who have helped me thus far in my academic journey!

Feel free to take a look at my [**research â†’**]({{ site.baseurl }}/research)

Alternatively, for my publications and more details about my academic life, please see my [**CV â†’**](/images/CV.pdf)

I can usually be found on my computer or reading!
A few things I've enjoyed recently:

- [How to do what you love.](https://www.paulgraham.com/love.html) As an undergraduate currently navigating the wild world of career self-discovery, I appreciate the perspective of someone wiser than I in finding a way to love life. 
- Good old-fashioned books ðŸ“–. Two recent favourites are [_Cat's Cradle_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/135479.Cat_s_Cradle) and [_The Caves of Steel._](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41811.The_Caves_of_Steel)
- [The Fermi Paradox](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html). One of my favorite topics to ponder.

Thank you to Jonathon Belotti for publishing and letting me use his source code for a website. I would not have been smart enough to set this up on my own.
