### I'm an amateur quantitative methodologist, computer scientist, and chess connoisseur (kind of). Welcome to my website!

### Here, you can find links to my research, blog, and contact information.

Currently, I'm an undergraduate student studying Psychology at the University of Oklahoma. I conduct research utilizing machine learning and factor analysis with an applied focus in student retention patterns and AI use among college students. Faculty I've worked closely with include Dr. Robert Terry, Dr. Jenel Cavazos, Dr. Lauren Grimley, and Dr. Eric Day. Thank you to all of those who have helped me thus far in my academic journey!

I can usually be found on my computer or reading!
A few things I've enjoyed recently:

- [How to do what you love.](https://www.paulgraham.com/love.html) As an undergraduate currently navigating the wild world of career self-discovery, I appreciate the perspective of someone wiser than I in finding a way to love life. 
- Good old-fashioned books ðŸ“–. Two recent favourites are [_Cat's Cradle_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/135479.Cat_s_Cradle) and [_The Caves of Steel._](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41811.The_Caves_of_Steel)
- [The Fermi Paradox](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html). One of my favorite topics to ponder.
