# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, <br/> I'm Keane Hauck.

### I'm an amateur quantitative psychologist, computer scientist, mathematician, and chess player. Welcome to my website! 

### Below, you can find links to my research, teaching experience, and contact information.

<br>

I can usually be found playing chess or reading.
I'm bullish on, and a big booster of:

- ðŸŒ¿ðŸ’š [@bazelbuild](https://github.com/bazelbuild/) and generally using functional principles to keep things sane. (I've open-sourced a few tools for the Bazel ecosystem, see [/projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects))
- Good old-fashioned books ðŸ“–. Two recent favourites are [_The Dispossessed_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13651.The_Dispossessed) and [_Coders at Work_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6713575-coders-at-work)
- [Effective Altruism](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/12/6/20992100/peter-singer-effective-altruism-lives-you-can-save-animal-liberation). Helping, not harming. Doing, not having. Building, not consuming.
