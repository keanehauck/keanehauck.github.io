# Hi there, <br/> I'm Keane Hauck.

### I'm an amateur quantitative psychologist, computer scientist, mathematician, and chess player. Welcome to my website! 

### Here, you can find links to my research, teaching experience, and contact information.

<br>

I can usually be found playing chess or reading. (note, this is  index.md)
Please enjoy a few things I find important:

- ðŸŒ¿ðŸ’š [How to do what you love.](https://www.paulgraham.com/love.html) As an undergraduate currently navigating the wild world of career self-discovery, I appreciate the perspective of someone wiser than I in finding a way to love life. 
- Good old-fashioned books ðŸ“–. Two recent favourites are [_Cat's Cradle_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/135479.Cat_s_Cradle) and [_Coders at Work_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41811.The_Caves_of_Steel)
- [The Fermi Paradox](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html). One of my favorite topics to ponder.

Thank you to Jonathon Belotti for letting me completely steal his source code for a website. I would not have been smart enough to set this up on my own.
