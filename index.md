### I'm an amateur quantitative methodologist, computer scientist, and chess connoisseur (I had to look up how to spell that word). Welcome to my website!

### Here, you can find links to my research, blog, and contact information. Please keep in mind that this website is a work in progress, and there may be multiple placeholder links!

I'm an undergraduate student studying Psychology at the University of Oklahoma.

I currently conduct research utilizing factor analysis and machine learning with an applied focus both in AI usage among college students and student retention patterns.

Thank you to Jonathon Belotti for publishing and letting me use his source code for a website. I would not have been smart enough to set this up on my own.
