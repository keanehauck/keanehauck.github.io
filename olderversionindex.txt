I can usually be found on my computer or reading!
A few things I've enjoyed recently:

- [How to do what you love.](https://www.paulgraham.com/love.html) As an undergraduate currently navigating the wild world of career self-discovery, I appreciate the perspective of someone wiser than I in finding a way to love life. 
- Good old-fashioned books ðŸ“–. Two recent favourites are [_Cat's Cradle_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/135479.Cat_s_Cradle) and [_The Caves of Steel._](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41811.The_Caves_of_Steel)
- [The Fermi Paradox](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html). One of my favorite topics to ponder.
