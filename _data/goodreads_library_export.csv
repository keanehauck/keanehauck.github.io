Strikingly funny, relevant, and inspirational, Ellen Potter cratfs a character in Owen Birnbaum that left-out children all over the world can relate to. This book played a huge role in cultivating my curiosity and love for science, and introduced me to the concept of a love that goes deeper than superficial characteristics. 10/10 - holds up even as an adult.
